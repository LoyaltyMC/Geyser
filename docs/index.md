Geyser is a bridge between Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition, closing the gap from those wanting to play true cross-platform.

Geyser is an open collaboration project by CubeCraft Games.

## What is Geyser?
Geyser is a proxy, bridging the gap between Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition servers.
The ultimate goal of this project is to allow Minecraft: Bedrock Edition users to join Minecraft: Java Edition servers as seamlessly as possible. **Please note, this project is still a work in progress and should not be used on production. Expect bugs!**

Special thanks to the DragonProxy project for being a trailblazer in protocol translation and for all the team members who have now joined us here!

!!! note
    Currently supporting Minecraft Bedrock v1.14.6(0) and Minecraft Java v1.15.2.
